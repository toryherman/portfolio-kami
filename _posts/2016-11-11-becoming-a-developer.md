title: From designer to developer
---

I have been working as a graphic designer for a publishing company for the past six years. It has been a wonderful experience learning the ins and outs of both the design and publishing worlds. I have learned a lot throughout my time as a graphic designer that has pushed me to evolve and pursue a career that I otherwise would not have envisioned for myself. 

I never had any intention of learning to code. It seemed too dry for me. But once I got a little experience with HTML and CSS, then Javascript, I realized that a lot what I loved about design, was also integral to development.

1. I love that every day I walk into work, I get to be creative. I get to **create** something. I value that I get to build something, that I will be able to see the results of my work, and that people will be able to interact with it. The same principle goes for software development.

2. A big part of the design process is constant **problem solving**. In graphic design, this is generally a visual form of problem solving; for example, determining how best to convey a message to the appropriate audience. Software development is also built upon the idea of problem solving. Software is fundamentally meant to provide a solution to a user's problem. Getting your code to work is constant problem solving. I am drawn to this. It may be that I always want to have the answer--*that I always need to be right*--but not much gets my gears moving more than searching for a solution to a problem.

3. Part of being both a good designer and a good developer is **attention to detail**. Nothing ruins good design like failing to pay proper attention to detail; it's often those little things that you don't notice until *they just aren't right*. (I guess you could say being a good designer is like being a good referee: you're doing your job best when nobody notices you!) That attention to detail is also of vital importance to development. Being lax when writing code will only result in code that does not work.

Recognizing these shared aspects was vital in pushing me towards development. On top of that is my strong desire to always be learning. Studying software development is satisfying that desire, as well as allowing me to attempt to reach my intellectual potential.
