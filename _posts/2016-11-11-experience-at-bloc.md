title: My Experience at Bloc (so far)
---

Upon completion of my first project in the Bloc Web Developer Track curriculum, I am satisfied. I have taken courses in the same subject matter previously, so I believe I have a little perspective on the positives and negatives of the program thus far.

The task of the first project was to build a digital music player like Spotify. While I succeeded in doing so, a lot of it was done through a hand holding teaching technique. I followed along with the instructions, often typing code verbatim. This was somewhat helpful in simply demonstrating the syntax, and necessary in the beginning learning stages, but in my opinion was used for too long. The few occasions when we were tasked with finding our own solutions, or to refactor code we had written previously, were when I felt I learned the most. While there may be a lot more frustration when you are thrown into the deep end to find the answer for yourself, I feel a lot more is also gained.

However, the sink-or-swim technique must be paired with open communication with an instructor or mentor to be successful. In my previous courses, projects were less structured, but they lacked the mentorship that is available at Bloc. Without that mentorship, bouts with frustration often felt hopeless. The value of having mentor meetings each week, as well as their accessibility via email, cannot be overstated.

Moving forward I am sure the hand holding will be tempered and the real work will begin. I can't wait to *really* start coding.
