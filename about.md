I am currently a graphic designer for both print and web at [1517 Media](http://1517.media), a publishing company in Minneapolis, Minnesota, that specializes in developing religious resources. I studied studio art in college and have evolved from painting and printmaking, to graphic design, and now to web development. I'm passionate about each step of this evolution as each area allows me to express my creativity and problem-solving skills in their own way.
