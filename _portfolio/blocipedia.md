Blocipedia is a project from the Bloc curriculum to create a Ruby on Rails application like Wikipedia and gain further understanding of Rails and back end web development. This application was built following a Test Driven Development process with Rspec. Authentication and authorization were handled using the devise and pundit gems, respectively. Stripe was also integrated to handle payments.
