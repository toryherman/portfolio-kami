In the Bloc curriculum, Blocitoff was intended to be a scheduling app. However, I saw a bigger need for a better way to make lists. My goal was to create a list making app which would allow the user to easily reorganize the contents of their lists by dragging and dropping. I achieved this using AngularJS, Firebase for storage and authentication, and UI-Sortable for sorting.
