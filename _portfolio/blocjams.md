Bloc Jams is a project from the Bloc curriculum to create a Spotify-like single page application using AngularJS and jQuery. This app was initially developed with plain Javascript and then adapted in order to get acquainted with the AngularJS framework and a Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.
