One of the highlights of my time at Bloc was being able to learn about developing Amazon Alexa skills. I have created three skills thus far: [Luther Quotes](https://www.amazon.com/Tory-Herman-Luther-Quotes/dp/B06Y1FHRTC), a skill allowing you to hear over 100 different quotes from Martin Luther; [Muscles 101](https://www.amazon.com/Tory-Herman-Muscles-101/dp/B0719VX7JP), a skill to aid in learning anatomy; and [Necktie Pro](https://www.amazon.com/Tory-Herman-Necktie-Pro/dp/B071D3LSJF), a step-by-step helper for tying various necktie knots. Each skill was developed using the Alexa Skills Kit SDK for Node.js and utilize SSML for Alexa's speech.
